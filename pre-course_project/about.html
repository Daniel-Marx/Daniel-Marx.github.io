            <p> Being a fan of information technology my whole life, I was always intered in how things work, and why they work that way. I've always considered a career in programming, not just because of my curiosity with it, but because it already is and will continue to be a to be a major part of our world. While learning with the Frontend Masters bootcamp, I found the material engaging and exciting. I can't wait to learn more and begin my career in coding!  </p>
